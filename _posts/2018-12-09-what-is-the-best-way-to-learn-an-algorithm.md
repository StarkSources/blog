#### the best way to learn an algorithm is to visualize it.

Some of the best Algorithm Visualizers:

[DataStructres Visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html)

The best way to understand complex data structures is to see them in action.
We've developed interactive animations for a variety of data structures and algorithms.
Our visualization tool is written in javascript using the HTML5 canvas element,
and run in just about any modern browser -- including iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad,
and even the web browser in the Kindle! (The frame rate is low enough in the Kindle that the visualizations aren't terribly useful,
but the tree-based visualizations -- BSTs and AVL Trees -- seem to work well enough)

### VisualAlgo

VisuAlgo loads fast for first time visitors, but it loads 'almost instantly' for returning visitors as we cache lots of static content of VisuAlgo :) (please do not use incognito or private browsing mode to keep the cache). Moreover, if you have registered a VisuAlgo account, we will load VisuAlgo according to your preferences after you login.
